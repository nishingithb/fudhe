### Project Description
FUDHE is a humorous and deliberately inaccurate web application that pretends to be an AI-powered food analyzer. Users can snap a photo of their food, and the app randomly detects what it is ‚Äî whether it's a burger, broccoli, or cake ‚Äî then provides completely nonsense nutrition facts that are the exact opposite of reality.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs world, people are overwhelmed with smart nutrition apps that claim to scan your food, detect ingredients, and provide ultra-accurate calorie counts ‚Äî all powered by "cutting-edge AI.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
the world‚Äôs first AI-powered* food analyzer that does absolutely nothing right‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the point!
